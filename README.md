tranverseFlutePractice  requires [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)  to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```Create an environment
Create a project folder and a venv folder within:

$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ python3 -m venv venv
On Windows:

$ py -3 -m venv venv
If you needed to install virtualenv because you are using Python 2, use the following command instead:

$ python2 -m virtualenv venv
On Windows:

> \Python27\Scripts\virtualenv.exe venv
Activate the environment
Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:

$ . venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

> venv\Scripts\activate
Your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment.
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
